# DistributedVirtualFileSystem

A console application written in Java that provides user an interface to create, delete, read and append to virtual(only text) files.

The application is an implementation of Raymond's Algorithm to synchronize access to virtual file resources in a distributed system.
Raymond's Algorithm is a lock based algorithm for mutual exclusion on a distributed system. It guarantees that the file resource is accessed by 
only one Process at a time.

Detailed explanation of the algorithm can be found at-
